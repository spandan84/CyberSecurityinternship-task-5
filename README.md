# CyberSecurityinternship-task-5#  Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## 🚀 Objective
Capture live network packets using Wireshark and analyze basic protocols and traffic types to gain hands-on packet analysis skills and protocol awareness.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (Free and open-source packet analyzer)

## 📋 Steps Followed
1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Started a packet capture on the active network interface.
3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and pinging servers.
4. Stopped the capture after 1 minute.
5. Applied filters to analyze specific protocols (e.g., `http`, `dns`, `tcp`).
6. Identified at least 3 different protocols from the capture.
7. Exported the capture as a `.pcap` file.
8. Summarized protocol details and packet information.

## 📁 Deliverables
- `capture.pcap`: The exported packet capture file.
- `report.md`: Summary of protocols identified and packet details.

## 📊 Protocols Identified
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Used for reliable communication.
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Used to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** Protocol used for web traffic.

## 📌 Key Concepts
- Packet Capture
- Protocol Analysis
- TCP/IP Stack
- Network Troubleshooting
- Packet Filtering

## 🎓 Concepts Learned
- Understanding of how network packets travel between hosts.
- Differences between various protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, and DNS.
- How to filter and analyze specific traffic using Wireshark.
- How packet inspection aids in diagnosing network issues and understanding network behavior.

## ✅ Conclusion
This task provided practical exposure to analyzing real-time network traffic using Wireshark. By identifying and filtering different types of protocols, I gained insights into how data is transmitted and received over a network. This hands-on experience enhanced my understanding of network protocols and packet structures, forming a strong foundation for further exploration in the field of cybersecurity and network analysis.
